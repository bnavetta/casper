# Notes

Basic idea: gradual alarm clock app

* Wake you up with a series of alarms
* Progress to lighter and lighter sleep stages
* Haptic feedback as later stage (MS Band, Apple Watch)
* All-out alarm if you're going to be late (x minutes after alarm scheduled for?)
* Simple test to make sure you're actually awake, not just hitting snooze or whatever
    * Type a word?
    * Solve a math problem
    * Swipe a pattern

# Design

* Minimalistic - not a lot of options / buttons
* Super minimalist learning curve
